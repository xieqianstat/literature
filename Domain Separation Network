L = L_task + αL_recon + βL_difference + γL_similarit

L_difference = |H_c^T H_p|_F (source) + |H_c^T H_p|_F (target), where ||_F denotes frobenious norm. 
If two matrix are orthogonal, then |I|_F is maximized.

L_similarity = domain adversarial similarity loss

Data: source domain with label for a classification task, target domain with no label.
